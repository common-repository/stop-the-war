== Description ==

We believe that collecting online donations should be easy and affordable. That’s why our WordPress donation plugin never charges transaction fees. 

Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine has brought to the forefront of the global consciousness a long-simmering geopolitical conflict. The situation is changing every minute as Russian troops move across the country and attack from once friendly countries, but the need for humanitarian assistance is obvious as the nation faces casualties and significant property damage.
